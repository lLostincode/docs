## What is Atthene Agents Studio?

Atthene Agents Studio is a development platform for creating and managing multi-agent AI systems. Configure agents using YAML, connect your data sources, test in real-time, and make it available inside Atthene or deploy via REST API or WebSocket — all from a unified interface.

## Who is this for?

This platform is built for **technical users** who want to build production-grade AI agents:

- **Developers** building AI-powered applications
- **AI Consultants** deploying custom agent solutions for clients
- **AI Coaches** prototyping and demonstrating multi-agent workflows

We assume you're comfortable with YAML configuration and API integration.

## Platform Architecture

Atthene Agents Studio runs on **German cloud infrastructure** (Open Telekom Cloud) operated by arttac solutions, ensuring data sovereignty and compliance with European regulations.

Your agents can be:
- **Tested** in the playground with instant feedback
- **Deployed** via REST API for server-side integration
- **Streamed** via WebSocket for real-time applications
- **Embedded** as public chatbots on your websites

## What Makes This Different?

Unlike point-and-click AI builders or code-heavy frameworks, Atthene Agents Studio sits in the middle:

- **Configuration over Code**: YAML-based setup means readable, version-controllable configs
- **Built for Multi-Agent**: Design complex workflows with agent coordination out of the box
- **Observability First**: See what your agents are doing with comprehensive tracing
- **Integration Ready**: Deploy via API, WebSocket, or embedded chatbot in minutes

If you're building production AI systems and want control without complexity, you're in the right place.
