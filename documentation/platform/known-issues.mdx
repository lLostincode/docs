## Current Limitations

### Platform Constraints

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Global Knowledge Bases & Tools" icon="database" defaultOpen>
    **Status**: Removed in v0.2.1
    
    Global knowledge bases and tools have been removed to simplify configuration. All knowledge bases and tools must now be configured per agent.
    
    **Migration**: Move global configurations to individual agent definitions.
    
    ```yaml
    # ❌ Old approach (no longer supported)
    global:
      knowledge_bases: [kb1, kb2]
      tools: [tool1, tool2]
    
    # ✅ New approach
    agents:
      - name: my_agent
        knowledge_bases: [kb1, kb2]
        tools: [tool1, tool2]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Manual RAG Deprecation" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Status**: Deprecated, removal planned for v0.3
    
    Manual RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) configuration is being phased out in favor of UKnow integration.
    
    **Action Required**: Migrate to UKnow for knowledge base management before v0.3 release.
    
    **Timeline**: Manual RAG will be fully removed in v0.3 (December 2025)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Model Provider Availability" icon="server">
    Not all model providers support all features:
    
    - **Tool Calling**: Not supported by Magistral, devstral-medium, mistral-moderation, and mistral-saba models
    - **Vision**: Limited to specific models (see [Model Selection](/documentation/agent_config/types_config/model-selection))
    - **Streaming**: Supported by most models, but may have provider-specific limitations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Known Issues

### High Priority

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Boolean Edge Key Interpretation" icon="code-branch" defaultOpen>
    **Issue**: Boolean edge keys `yes` and `no` are interpreted as `True`/`False` in YAML parsing.
    
    **Impact**: Conditional edges with boolean routing may fail or route incorrectly.
    
    **Workaround**: Use quoted keys in your YAML configuration:
    
    ```yaml
    edges:
      - from: decision_agent
        condition: "Should we proceed?"
        condition_type: boolean
        routing:
          "yes": approval_agent  # ✅ Quoted
          "no": rejection_agent  # ✅ Quoted
    ```
    
    **Status**: Fix planned for v0.2.2
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="First Message Timing in AMAS Chat" icon="message">
    **Issue**: The first user message in AMAS Chat appears after the first agent message instead of before.
    
    **Impact**: Chat history display order is incorrect for the initial exchange.
    
    **Workaround**: None currently. This is a UI display issue and doesn't affect functionality.
    
    **Status**: Fix in progress
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Medium Priority

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OneDrive SharePoint Cross-Query" icon="microsoft">
    **Issue**: OneDrive configuration also queries from SharePoint sites when using broad drive IDs.
    
    **Impact**: May retrieve documents from unintended SharePoint locations.
    
    **Workaround**: Only include drive IDs ending with `.../me/<your_email>` to limit scope to personal OneDrive:
    
    ```yaml
    knowledge_base:
      provider: uknow
      config:
        sources:
          - type: onedrive
            drive_id: "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/your.email@company.com"
    ```
    
    **Status**: Investigating improved filtering options
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Window Context Loss" icon="window">
    **Issue**: Switching browser windows or tabs may cause loss of selected agent context.
    
    **Impact**: Users need to reselect their agent after switching windows.
    
    **Status**: Fixed in v0.2.1
    
    <Check>
      This issue has been resolved. Update to v0.2.1 or later.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authorization UI Update" icon="shield-check">
    **Issue**: Authorized UI doesn't update immediately after successful authorization.
    
    **Impact**: Users may not see authorization status change without page refresh.
    
    **Status**: Fixed in v0.2.1
    
    <Check>
      This issue has been resolved. Update to v0.2.1 or later.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Low Priority

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Google Drive Security Status" icon="google">
    **Issue**: Google Drive provider is marked as "insecure" in UKnow integration.
    
    **Impact**: Google Drive integration is available but flagged with security warning.
    
    **Reason**: UKnow is currently undergoing security re-issuance for Google Drive OAuth.
    
    **Status**: Official support coming shortly after security certification
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pydantic Error Messages" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Issue**: Pydantic validation error messages could be more user-friendly.
    
    **Impact**: Technical error messages may be difficult for non-developers to understand.
    
    **Status**: Improved in v0.2.1
    
    <Check>
      Error messages have been enhanced in v0.2.1 with clearer, more actionable feedback.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Considerations

### Response Times

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Typical Response Times" icon="clock" iconType="duotone">
    - **Simple LLM Agent**: 1-3 seconds
    - **React Agent with Tools**: 3-10 seconds
    - **Multi-Agent Workflow**: 5-30 seconds
    - **Vision/OCR Tasks**: 5-15 seconds
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Factors Affecting Speed" icon="gauge" iconType="duotone">
    - Model selection (GPT-4o-mini is faster)
    - Number of tools available
    - Knowledge base size
    - Workflow complexity
    - Image/document size
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  For latency-sensitive applications, use GPT-4o-mini or Mistral Medium models and limit the number of tools per agent.
</Tip>

### Token Usage

<Warning>
  **Context Window Management**: Large knowledge bases and long conversation histories can quickly consume token limits.
</Warning>

**Best Practices:**
- Use `include_history: true` with `history_length: 5` instead of `include_full_history: true`
- Implement conversation summarization for long sessions
- Limit knowledge base scope to relevant documents
- Use structured outputs to reduce response verbosity
