  Level up your multi-agent experiences by embedding flow logic directly into edges.
</Card>

You now have two edge types to choose from:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Static Edges">
    Direct connections between agents:
    
    ```yaml
    edges:
      # Simple static routing
      - from: START
        to: analyzer
      
      - from: analyzer
        to: processor
      
      - from: processor
        to: END
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Boolean Conditional">
    Yes/No routing decisions (approval gates, quality checks):
    
    ```yaml
    edges:
      - from: quality_checker
        condition: |
          Quality Check: {{ quality_checker.output }}
          
          Is the solution of sufficient quality?
          
          Respond with YES or NO.
        condition_type: boolean
        routing:
          "yes": publisher
          "no": reviser
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Literal Conditional">
    Dynamic routing to specific agents based on classification:
    
    ```yaml
    edges:
      - from: classifier
        condition: |
          User Request: {{ user_input }}
          
          Route to the appropriate agent:
          - technical_support for technical issues
          - billing_support for payment questions
          - general_support for other inquiries
          
          Respond with ONLY the agent name.
        condition_type: literal
        possible_outputs:
          - technical_support
          - billing_support
          - general_support
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Complete Example:**

```yaml
name: Support Router
architecture: workflow

agents:
  - name: classifier
    agent_type: llm_agent
    prompt_config:
      system_prompt: Classify incoming support requests
  
  - name: technical_support
    agent_type: react_agent
    tools: [search, documentation]
  
  - name: billing_support
    agent_type: llm_agent

edges:
  - from: START
    to: classifier
  
  # Conditional routing based on classification
  - from: classifier
    condition: "Route based on: {{ classifier.output }}"
    condition_type: literal
    possible_outputs: [technical_support, billing_support]
```

<Warning>
  **Known Issue**: Boolean edge keys `yes` and `no` are interpreted as `True`/`False`.
  
  **Workaround**: Use quoted keys in your YAML:
  ```yaml
  routing:
    "yes": agent_name
    "no": other_agent
  ```
</Warning>

### Structured Output with BAML

<Card title="Industry-Leading Reliability" icon="shield-check" iconType="duotone" color="#10b981">
  Struggling with reliability in producing structured JSON output? We've got you covered.
</Card>

Utilizing **BAML** (thanks to [BoundaryML](https://www.boundaryml.com/)), we guarantee the highest reliability in the industry for structured outputs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Schema">
    Specify the exact JSON structure you need
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Guaranteed Validation">
    BAML ensures outputs match your schema every time
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type Safety">
    Get strongly-typed responses with full validation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Error Recovery">
    Automatic retry and correction for malformed outputs
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example Configuration:**

```yaml
agents:
  - name: data_extractor
    agent_type: llm_agent
    prompt_config:
      system_prompt: |
        Extract structured data from customer inquiries.
        Focus on identifying key information accurately.
    
    structured_output:
      enabled: true
      output_name: customer_data
      schema:
        customer_name:
          type: str
          description: Full name of the customer
        
        email:
          type: str
          description: Customer email address
        
        order_id:
          type: str
          description: Order or ticket ID if mentioned
        
        priority:
          type: str
          description: Priority level (high, medium, low)
        
        issue_category:
          type: str
          description: Category of the issue
```

**Output Format:**

```json
{
  "customer_data": {
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "order_id": "ORD-12345",
    "priority": "high",
    "issue_category": "billing"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Structured outputs are perfect for data extraction, classification, form filling, and any task requiring consistent JSON responses.
