description: "Generate complete AMAS agent configurations from natural language descriptions using AI"
---

The AI Config Generator allows you to create complete AMAS YAML configurations from simple natural language descriptions. Instead of manually writing YAML, describe what you want your agent system to do, and the AI will generate a production-ready configuration.

## Overview

The AI Config Generator uses advanced language models to:

1. Understand your natural language description
2. Determine the appropriate agent architecture
3. Select relevant tools and capabilities
4. Generate a complete, valid YAML configuration
5. Apply best practices automatically

<Info>
The generator uses advanced AI and structured output to ensure valid configurations that follow AMAS best practices.

## How It Works

The AI Config Generator is available through the AMAS platform interface. Simply provide a natural language description of what you want your agent system to do, and the generator will create a complete YAML configuration.

## Writing Effective Descriptions

### Good Descriptions

<Check>
**Specific use case**: "Create a customer support ticket routing system that categorizes tickets and assigns them to specialized agents"
</Check>

<Check>
**Mentions data needs**: "Extract product reviews and analyze sentiment, rating, pros, and cons as structured data"
</Check>

<Check>
**Describes workflow**: "First classify content safety, then route safe content to publishing and unsafe content to moderation"
</Check>

<Check>
**Includes tools**: "Use web search to research competitors, then analyze the data and generate a report"
</Check>

### Avoid

<Warning>
**Too vague**: "Create an agent" - Not enough information about what the agent should do
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Too complex**: Describing every single detail - Let the AI determine implementation details
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Conflicting requirements**: "Make it fast but also very thorough with multiple validation steps"
</Warning>

## Example Use Cases

### Data Extraction

```json Request
{
  "description": "Create a resume parser that extracts candidate name, email, phone, years of experience, skills list, and education level from resume text"
}
```

The AI will generate a configuration with:
- LLM agent with structured output
- Schema for all required fields
- Appropriate type notations (str, int, list[str])
- System prompt for accurate extraction

### Content Moderation

```json Request
{
  "description": "Build a content moderation system that analyzes user posts, classifies them as safe, questionable, or unsafe, and routes them accordingly. Safe posts get published immediately, questionable posts go to human review, and unsafe posts are rejected."
}
```

The AI will generate:
- Classifier agent with structured output
- Conditional routing based on safety level
- Multiple handler agents for each path
- Workflow architecture with proper edges

### Research Pipeline

```json Request
{
  "description": "Design a competitive intelligence system: Agent 1 uses web search to gather competitor data, Agent 2 analyzes trends and threats, Agent 3 generates a comprehensive report. Pass structured data between agents."
}
```

The AI will generate:
- Multi-agent workflow architecture
- ReAct agent with web search tool
- Structured output for data passing
- Template variables for dependency injection
- Sequential workflow edges

## Using Generated Configurations

### 1. Review and Validate

Always review the generated configuration before use:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check agent types">
    Verify the AI selected appropriate agent types (llm_agent, react_agent, supervisor)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review system prompts">
    Ensure system prompts are clear and aligned with your requirements
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate structured output">
    Check that schemas include all necessary fields with correct types
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify workflow logic">
    Confirm edges and routing match your intended flow
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Test the Configuration

Test the generated configuration in the AMAS platform to ensure it works as expected.

### 3. Deploy

Once validated, deploy the configuration to create your agent system.

## Iterative Refinement

<Tip>
If the generated configuration isn't quite right, refine your description and regenerate. Be more specific about what needs to change.
</Tip>

**Example refinement:**

Initial: "Create a support system"

Refined: "Create a support system that uses structured output to extract ticket category, priority, and summary, then routes to specialized agents based on category"

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Start Simple**: Begin with a basic description, review the output, then add complexity in subsequent generations
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Specify Tools**: If you need specific tools (web search, knowledge base, etc.), mention them in your description
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Mention Data Structure**: If you need structured output, describe the fields you want to extract
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Always Validate**: Never deploy generated configurations without reviewing and testing them first
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Learn from Output**: Study the generated configurations to learn AMAS patterns and best practices
</Tip>

## Limitations

<Note>
- The AI generates based on common patterns and may not cover all edge cases
- Complex custom logic may require manual adjustments
- Tool availability depends on your AMAS installation
- Generated prompts are starting points and may need refinement
- Very specific domain requirements may need manual configuration
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
**Generation Failed**: If configuration generation fails, try rephrasing your description or simplifying requirements
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Unexpected Results**: If the generated configuration doesn't match expectations, be more specific in your description about agents, tools, and workflow
</Tip>

<Note>
**Complex Requirements**: Very specific domain requirements may need manual adjustments after generation
</Note>
