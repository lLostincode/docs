## Dashboard Overview

At the top, you'll see quick stats:
- **Total Agents**: Number of agents you've created
- **Active**: Agents currently deployed
- **Runs**: Total execution count
- **Total Tokens**: Cumulative token usage

## Agent List

Each agent card shows:
- Agent name and description
- Current version number
- Creation date
- Quick action buttons (Edit, Delete, Settings)

### Quick Actions

**Edit**: Opens the agent in the Playground for modifications

**Settings**: Access version management and deployment options

**Delete**: Remove the agent permanently

## Managing Agent Versions

Click the **Settings** icon on any agent to access version management:

</Frame>

### Understanding Versions

Every time you save changes to an agent, a new version is created. This gives you:
- **Version history**: See all previous configurations
- **Easy rollback**: Revert to an older version if needed
- **Safe experimentation**: Test changes without losing the working version

### Version States

<Frame>
  ![Version Management](/screens/agent_versions.png)
</Frame>

**Current Badge**: The version that's actively deployed and handles all API requests

**Historical Versions**: Previous configurations you can view or deploy

### Deploying a Version

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Agent Settings">
    Click the settings icon on your agent
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to Versions Tab">
    View all available versions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Deploy">
    Click the **Deploy** button next to the version you want to activate
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    This version becomes the "Current" version and handles all requests
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Deploying a version immediately affects:
- API endpoints
- Embedded chatbots
- WebSocket connections

Test thoroughly in the Playground before deploying!
</Warning>

## Agent Settings

Click the **Settings** button on any agent to access detailed configuration. The Settings modal has four tabs:

### General

<Frame>
  ![Agent Settings General](/screens/agent_settings_general.png)
</Frame>

- **Public Access**: Enable WebSocket access for external clients
- **Agent Key**: Unique identifier for API/WebSocket connections
- **Origin URL**: Allowed domain for public access (CORS)
- **Agent Details**: View architecture, entry point, and last update time

<Note>
When Public Access is enabled, you must specify an allowed origin URL for security.
</Note>

### Access Control

<Frame>
  ![Access Control Settings](/screens/access_control.png)

Control who can see and use your agent:

**Share with Company**
- When enabled, other users in your organization can view and use this agent in AMAS
- Only you (the owner) can modify settings

**Show in Atthene**
- When enabled, agent appears in the Atthene frontend interface
- Works alongside company sharing

<Info>
**Access Summary:**
- **AMAS**: Shows your agents + shared company agents
- **Atthene**: Shows agents with "Show in Atthene" enabled
- **Public Chatbot**: Configured via Public Access in General tab
</Info>

### Versions

<Frame>

- **View all versions**: See complete version history
- **Deploy button**: Activate a specific version (makes it "Current")
- **View Config**: Open version's YAML in Playground
- **Current badge**: Shows which version is actively deployed

### Statistics

<Frame>
  ![Agent Statistics](/screens/agent_statistics.png)
</Frame>

**Overview**
- Total Sessions
- Total Answer Generations

**Token Usage**
- Input Tokens
- Output Tokens  
- Total Tokens

**Averages**

## Creating New Versions

When you edit a saved agent in the Playground:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Config on Agent Card">
    Opens the agent in Playground with current version loaded
    
    <Frame>
      ![Loading Agent](/screens/agent_loading.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make Your Changes">
    Edit the YAML configuration as needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save as New Version">
    Click **Save as New Version** button (only appears when editing)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Version Created">
    A new version is automatically created and appears in the Versions tab
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The Playground shows a version dropdown when editing an agent. This lets you switch between versions to view their configurations.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Test before deploying**: Always test new versions in the Playground before deploying to production
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Keep a stable version**: Maintain one tested version as "production" while experimenting with new ones
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Monitor statistics**: Use the Statistics tab to track usage patterns and optimize performance
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Check access control**: Review who can access your agent before enabling company sharing
</Tip>

## Sharing Agents

To share an agent with your organization:

1. Click **Settings** on the agent card
2. Go to **Access Control** tab
3. Enable **Share with Company**
4. Optionally enable **Show in Atthene** to make it visible in the Atthene interface

<Info>
Shared agents are read-only for other users. Only the owner can modify settings or deploy versions.
</Info>

## Common Questions

**Q: What happens to my API connections when I deploy a new version?**

A: They immediately start using the new version. No downtime, but behavior may change based on your config updates.

**Q: Can I restore a deleted agent?**

A: No. Deletion is permanent. Make sure you export the YAML configuration if you might need it later.

**Q: How many versions can I have?**

A: Unlimited. All versions are stored and accessible.
