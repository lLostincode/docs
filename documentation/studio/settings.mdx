The Settings page is where you manage API keys for accessing agents and configure OAuth integrations for toolkits.

## Settings Sections

### API Keys

<Frame>
  ![API Keys](/images/api_keys.png)
</Frame>

API Keys let external applications access your agents.

#### Creating an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Create New Key">
    Opens the key creation dialog
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Expiration">
    Choose when the key should expire (for security)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy the Key">
    **Important**: Copy the key immediately. You won't see it again!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
API keys have full access to your account. Anyone with the key can execute agents, access knowledge bases, and manage configurations.
</Note>

<Warning>
Store API keys securely. They grant full access to your account.
</Warning>

#### Using API Keys

Include the API key in your requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://amas.atthene.com/api/amas/conversations/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
    "message": "Hello!"
  }'
```

#### Managing Keys

- **Rotate regularly**: Create new keys and delete old ones every few months
- **Monitor usage**: Check API key usage in the dashboard
- **Revoke immediately**: If a key is compromised, delete it right away

<Note>
You can only have one valid API key at a time. Creating a new key will invalidate the previous one.
</Note>

### Integrations

Manage OAuth integrations for toolkits (Microsoft Outlook, Teams, etc.).

<Frame>
  ![All Integrations](/images/all_integrations.png)
</Frame>

#### How Integrations Work

Integrations control how users authenticate with external services (like Microsoft Outlook or Teams) when using toolkits.

**ATTHENE's Default Integration**: If you don't configure a custom integration, ATTHENE provides a pre-configured OAuth app that works immediately. When users authorize a toolkit connection, they'll use ATTHENE's app by default.

**Custom Integration**: You can add your own OAuth app credentials (Client ID & Secret) from your Azure portal. When users authorize connections, they can choose to use your custom integration instead. This gives your organization full control over OAuth permissions and policies.

**Setting a Default**: If you create multiple custom integrations, you can mark one as "default." This integration will be pre-selected (but not required) when users authorize new connections.

<Note>
For now, we only support **Microsoft** as a provider. Support for Google, Slack, and other providers coming soon.
</Note>

#### Adding a Custom Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Integration">
    <Frame>
      ![Add Company Integration](/images/add_company_integration.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Provider">
    Choose **Microsoft** (only option for now)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter OAuth Credentials">
    Provide:
    - **Integration Name**: e.g., "Company Outlook"
    - **OAuth Client ID**: From your Azure app
    - **OAuth Client Secret**: From your Azure app  
    - **OAuth Scopes**: Required permissions (e.g., `Mail.Read`, `Mail.Send`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create">
    Your custom integration is now available for users to connect to
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Setting a Default Integration

If you have multiple custom integrations for the same provider:

1. Find the integration in the list
2. Click **Set as Default**
3. This integration will be used by default for all new connections


#### When to Use Custom Integrations

- **Organization policies**: Your company requires using internal OAuth apps
- **Custom permissions**: You need specific Microsoft Graph scopes
- **Compliance**: Data must stay within your Azure tenant

<Info>
Integrations configured here are used when creating **toolkit connections** in the Tools page. See [Tools - Toolkits](/documentation/studio/tools#toolkits) for how users authorize connections.
</Info>

## Security Best Practices

<Tip>
**Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant the minimum permissions needed
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Rotate Credentials**: Change API keys regularly
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Never commit secrets**: Don't put API keys in YAML files or git repositories
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Monitor Access**: Regularly review API key usage and integration logs
</Tip>

## Common Tasks

### Revoking an API Key

1. Go to Settings → API Keys
2. Find the key to revoke
3. Click the trash icon
4. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Applications using this key will immediately stop working
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
**"Unauthorized" errors**: Check if your API key has expired or been revoked
</Warning>
