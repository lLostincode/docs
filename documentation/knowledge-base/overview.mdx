Knowledge bases provide agents with access to domain-specific information, documents, and organizational knowledge. AMAS supports two types of knowledge bases, each optimized for different use cases.

## Available Knowledge Base Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Milvus" icon="database" href="/guides/knowledge-base/milvus">
    **Vector Database** ✅
    
    Production-ready vector database with semantic search capabilities. Upload documents and perform semantic search over embeddings.
    
    **Best for:** Custom document collections, uploaded files, fine-grained control
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="UKnow" icon="cloud" href="/guides/knowledge-base/uknow-cloud-storage">
    **Cloud Storage** ✅
    
    Connect Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and SharePoint via OAuth. Search cloud documents without manual uploads.
    
    **Best for:** Existing cloud storage, live document access, no file management
  </Card>

## Comparison

| Feature | Milvus | UKnow |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Data Source** | Uploaded files | Cloud storage (OAuth) |
| **Setup** | Upload documents to collections | Connect cloud account |
| **Search Type** | Semantic vector search | Semantic search via UKnow API |
| **File Management** | Manual upload/delete | Automatic sync from cloud |
| **Customization** | Full control (chunking, embeddings) | Managed by UKnow |
| **Best For** | Custom knowledge bases | Existing cloud documents |

## When to Use Each Type

### Use Milvus When:

<Check>
You need full control over document processing and chunking
</Check>

<Check>
Building custom knowledge bases from uploaded files
</Check>

<Check>
Want to fine-tune embedding models and retrieval parameters
</Check>

<Check>
Need to manage document lifecycle (add, update, delete)
</Check>

### Use UKnow When:

<Check>
Documents already exist in Google Drive, SharePoint, etc.
</Check>

<Check>
Want automatic sync with cloud storage
</Check>

<Check>
Need to search across multiple cloud providers
</Check>

<Check>
Prefer OAuth-based access over file uploads
</Check>

## Configuration Basics

### Milvus Configuration

```yaml
knowledge_bases:
  - name: "company_docs"
    knowledge_base_type: "milvus"
    id: "kb_abc123"
    config:
      top_k: 10
      metric_type: "COSINE"
```

### UKnow Configuration

```yaml
knowledge_bases:
  - name: "sharepoint_docs"
    knowledge_base_type: "uknow"
    enabled: true
    config:
      username: "user@company.com"
      drive_key: "oauth_key_123"
      path_filter: "/documents/"
```

## Using Multiple Knowledge Bases

Agents can use multiple knowledge bases simultaneously:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "comprehensive_assistant"
    agent_type: "llm_agent"
    
    knowledge_bases:
      # Vector database for uploaded docs
      - name: "internal_kb"
        knowledge_base_type: "milvus"
        id: "kb_001"
        config:
          top_k: 5
      
      # Cloud storage for live docs
      - name: "sharepoint"
        knowledge_base_type: "uknow"
        enabled: true
        config:
          username: "user@company.com"
          drive_key: "key_123"
          path_filter: "/"
    
    system_prompt: |
      You have access to both internal documentation and live SharePoint files.
      Search both knowledge bases to provide comprehensive answers.
```

## How Knowledge Bases Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent Receives Query">
    User asks a question that requires domain knowledge
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Semantic Search">
    Agent searches configured knowledge bases using semantic similarity
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Retrieve Relevant Documents">
    Top-k most relevant documents/chunks are retrieved
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Context Injection">
    Retrieved content is added to agent's context
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Response">
    Agent generates response using both its knowledge and retrieved context
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Start Small**: Begin with one knowledge base type and expand as needed
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Combine Types**: Use Milvus for stable internal docs and UKnow for dynamic cloud content
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Tune Retrieval**: Adjust `top_k` and search parameters based on your use case
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Token Limits**: More knowledge bases = more retrieved content. Monitor token usage and adjust retrieval settings accordingly.
</Warning>
