description: "Create and manage knowledge bases for agent retrieval"
---

The Knowledge Bases API allows you to create and manage knowledge bases that agents can query for information. Knowledge bases organize collections and data sources for AI-powered retrieval and augmented generation.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Retrieval**: Vector-based semantic search
- **Multiple Processing Engines**: Milvus and Cognee support
- **Collection Integration**: Build from organized file collections
- **Status Monitoring**: Track processing and health
- **Agent Integration**: Direct use in agent configurations

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication using your API key:
- **API Key**: `x-api-key: <key>`

## Processing Engines

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Milvus">
    **Vector Database Engine**
    - High-performance vector similarity search
    - Scalable for large document collections
    - Advanced indexing algorithms
    - Real-time updates and queries
    
    Best for: Large-scale deployments, high-performance requirements
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cognee">
    **Graph-Based Engine**
    - Knowledge graph construction
    - Relationship extraction
    - Contextual understanding
    - Multi-hop reasoning
    
    Best for: Complex reasoning, relationship-heavy content
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Knowledge Base Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
Define knowledge base with collections and processing engine:
```json
{
  "name": "Product Knowledge Base",
  "description": "Product documentation and guides",
  "processing_engine": "milvus",
  "collections": ["coll_123", "coll_456"]
}
```

### 2. Processing
Knowledge base processes collection content:
- **Text extraction**: Extract and chunk content
- **Embedding generation**: Create vector representations
- **Index building**: Optimize for search performance
- **Validation**: Ensure data quality

### 3. Completion
Ready knowledge bases can be used by agents for retrieval.

## Knowledge Base Status

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="pending">
    Knowledge base created but processing not started
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="running">
    Collections are being processed and indexed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="completed">
    All collections processed and ready for queries
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="failed">
    Processing failed - check error details and logs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data Sources and Collections

Knowledge bases track their data sources:

<ResponseField name="ingested_datasources" type="array">
  Successfully processed data sources with metadata
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="failed_datasources" type="array">
  Data sources that failed processing with error details
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="success_rate" type="number">
  Percentage of successfully processed data sources
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="collection_count" type="integer">
  Number of collections included in the knowledge base
</ResponseField>

## Agent Integration

Use knowledge bases in agent configurations:

```yaml
name: "Support Agent"
agent_type: "llm_agent"
system_prompt: "You are a helpful support agent..."
knowledge_bases:
  - name: "product_kb"
    knowledge_base_type: "milvus"
    knowledge_base_id: "kb_123"
```

### Retrieval Configuration
- **Search parameters**: Control relevance and results
- **Context integration**: How retrieved content is used
- **Fallback behavior**: When no relevant content is found

<Tip>
Test knowledge base queries before deploying agents to ensure relevant results.
</Tip>

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Time
- **Collection size**: Larger collections take longer to process
- **Content complexity**: Rich documents require more processing
- **Engine choice**: Different engines have varying performance characteristics

### Query Performance
- **Index optimization**: Proper indexing improves search speed
- **Result filtering**: Limit results for faster responses
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed content is cached

### Scalability
- **Concurrent queries**: Multiple agents can query simultaneously
- **Update frequency**: How often content changes
- **Storage requirements**: Vector storage grows with content

<Warning>
Large knowledge bases may require significant processing time. Plan for appropriate indexing windows.
</Warning>

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Health Checks
- **Processing progress**: Track completion percentage
- **Error rates**: Monitor failed data sources
- **Query performance**: Response times and accuracy

### Common Issues
- **Collection dependencies**: Ensure collections are completed
- **Processing failures**: Check data source formats and content
- **Memory limits**: Large knowledge bases may hit resource limits

<Info>
Use the status endpoint to monitor knowledge base health and processing progress.
