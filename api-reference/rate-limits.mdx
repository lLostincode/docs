# Rate Limits

To ensure the stability and availability of the Multi-Agentic Workforce Platform API for all users, we implement rate limits on API requests. These limits vary by endpoint and account tier.

## Rate Limit Overview

<Info>
Rate limits are applied on a per-API key basis, not per account. If you have multiple API keys, each key has its own independent rate limit.
</Info>

## Rate Limit Headers

All API responses include headers that provide information about your current rate limit status:

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Limit" type="integer">
  The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make per minute.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Remaining" type="integer">
  The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Reset" type="integer">
  The time at which the current rate limit window resets in Unix epoch seconds.
</ParamField>

<CodeGroup>
```bash Example Response Headers
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-RateLimit-Limit: 50
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 49
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1699564860
```
</CodeGroup>

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed your rate limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after 2023-11-10T00:01:00Z",
    "retry_after": 45
  }
}
```

<ParamField body="error.retry_after" type="integer">
  The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request.
</ParamField>

<Warning>
Repeatedly exceeding rate limits may result in temporary or permanent restrictions on your API access.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement Exponential Backoff">
    When you receive a rate limit error, implement exponential backoff with jitter to retry your requests:
    
    ```javascript
    function backoff(retry, maxRetries = 5) {
      if (retry > maxRetries) return false;
      
      // Calculate delay with exponential backoff and jitter
      const delay = Math.min(
        Math.pow(2, retry) * 1000 + Math.random() * 1000,
        60000 // Max 60 seconds
      );
      
      return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
    
    async function makeRequestWithBackoff(url, options, retry = 0) {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url, options);
        
        if (response.status === 429) {
          const data = await response.json();
          const retryAfter = data.error.retry_after || 1;
          
          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter * 1000));
          return makeRequestWithBackoff(url, options, retry + 1);
        }
        
        return response;
      } catch (error) {
        if (await backoff(retry)) {
          return makeRequestWithBackoff(url, options, retry + 1);
        }
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch Requests When Possible">
    Instead of making many small requests, batch operations when possible:
    
    - Use bulk creation endpoints when available
    - Process items in batches rather than individually
    - Combine related operations into single requests
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cache Responses">
    Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data that doesn't change often:
    
    - Cache agent configurations
    - Cache reference data
    - Respect Cache-Control headers in API responses
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Your Usage">
    Regularly check your API usage in the dashboard to:
    
    - Identify usage patterns
    - Detect unexpected spikes
    - Plan for scaling needs
    - Optimize inefficient API usage
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limit Increases

If you need higher rate limits than what your current tier provides:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Evaluate your needs">
    Monitor your current usage and determine the rate limits you require.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Optimize your implementation">
    Review the best practices above to ensure you're using the API efficiently.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upgrade your plan">
    Consider upgrading to a higher tier plan with increased rate limits.
