# Multi-Agentic Workforce Platform API

Welcome to the API reference documentation for the Multi-Agentic Workforce Platform. This API allows you to programmatically create, configure, and execute intelligent agents for a wide range of tasks and workflows.

## API Overview

The Multi-Agentic Workforce Platform API is organized around REST principles. It accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agents">
    Agents are the core entities in the platform. Each agent has a configuration that defines its capabilities, instructions, and behavior. Agents can be created on-the-fly or saved for repeated use.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Runs">
    A run represents a single execution instance of an agent. Each run maintains its own conversation history and state. Runs can be short-lived for simple tasks or long-running for complex workflows.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tools">
    Tools are capabilities that agents can use to interact with external systems or perform specific functions. Examples include web search, code interpretation, and knowledge base access.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Messages">
    Messages represent the conversation between users and agents. Each message has a role (user or assistant) and content.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Sign up for an account and generate an API key from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.yourdomain.com).
    
    <Warning>
    Keep your API keys secure! Do not expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make your first API call">
    Try validating a simple agent configuration:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/agents/validate \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "config": {
          "name": "My First Agent",
          "model": "gpt-4",
          "instructions": "You are a helpful assistant."
        }
      }'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create and execute a run">
    Once your configuration is valid, create and execute a run to start interacting with your agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>
