Welcome to the API reference documentation for the Atthene Multi-Agent System (AMAS). This API allows you to programmatically create, configure, and execute intelligent agents for a wide range of tasks and workflows.

## API Overview

The AMAS API is organized around REST principles. It accepts JSON and YAML-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agents">
    Agents are AI-powered entities configured with specific capabilities, instructions, and behaviors. AMAS supports two types: **LLM Agents** (conversational) and **ReAct Agents** (tool-using, reasoning agents).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sessions">
    A session represents a conversation instance with an agent. Each session maintains its own message history and state. Sessions are created with a complete agent configuration in YAML or JSON format.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tools">
    Tools extend agent capabilities by providing access to external systems. Examples include web search (Tavily), calculators, and custom integrations. Only ReAct agents support tool calling.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Knowledge Bases">
    Knowledge bases provide agents with access to domain-specific information through semantic search. AMAS supports Milvus vector database for production-ready retrieval.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Collections & Files">
    Files are uploaded documents that can be organized into collections. Collections group related data sources for knowledge base ingestion and management.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Contact your administrator or use the dashboard to generate an API key.
    
    <Warning>
    Keep your API keys secure! Do not expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate your agent configuration">
    Test your agent configuration before creating a session:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST https://api-be.atthene.com/api/v1/agent/validate/ \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "My First Agent",
        "agent_type": "llm_agent",
        "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        "llm_config": {
          "model": "gpt-4o",
          "temperature": 0.7
        }
      }'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a session and execute">
    Create a session with your configuration and start executing messages:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash cURL
    # Create session
    curl -X POST https://api-be.atthene.com/api/v1/sessions/ \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "My Session",
        "agent_type": "llm_agent",
        "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        "llm_config": {"model": "gpt-4o"}
      }'
    
    # Execute message
    curl -X POST https://api-be.atthene.com/api/v1/runtime/SESSION_ID/execute/ \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"content": "Hello, how can you help me?"}'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
