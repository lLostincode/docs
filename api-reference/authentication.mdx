# Authentication

The Multi-Agentic Workforce Platform API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.yourdomain.com).

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure! Do not share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or in your application's source code.
</Warning>

## API Key Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Production Keys">
    Production keys have full access to all API endpoints and features. These should be used in your production environment.
    
    <Note>
    Production keys are subject to your account's rate limits and billing.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Development Keys">
    Development keys have the same capabilities as production keys but are intended for testing and development. They have separate, typically lower, rate limits.
    
    <Info>
    API calls made with development keys are clearly marked in the dashboard for easier debugging.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Restricted Keys">
    Restricted keys can be configured with limited permissions, such as read-only access or access to specific agents only.
    
    <Tip>
    Use restricted keys for client-side applications or when granting API access to third parties.
    </Tip>

## Authentication Methods

### Bearer Token Authentication

All API requests must include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer scheme.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/agents/validate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "config": {
      "name": "My Agent"
    }
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

axios.post('https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/agents/validate', {
  config: {
    name: 'My Agent'
  }
}, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(response => console.log(response.data))
.catch(error => console.error(error));
```

```python Python
import requests

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/agents/validate',
    json={'config': {'name': 'My Agent'}},
    headers=headers
)

print(response.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

## API Key Management

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a new API key">
    1. Log in to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.yourdomain.com)
    2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
    3. Click **Create New API Key**
    4. Enter a descriptive name for your key
    5. Select the key type (Production, Development, or Restricted)
    6. For Restricted keys, configure the appropriate permissions
    7. Click **Generate Key**
    
    <Warning>
    The API key will only be displayed once. Make sure to copy it and store it securely.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rotate your API keys">
    We recommend regularly rotating your API keys as a security best practice:
    
    1. Generate a new API key
    2. Update your applications to use the new key
    3. Monitor usage to ensure the new key is working correctly
    4. Delete the old API key
    
    <Check>
    Regular key rotation minimizes the risk of unauthorized API access if a key is compromised.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Environment Variables" icon="leaf">
    Store API keys as environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your application.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Key Permissions" icon="lock">
    Use the principle of least privilege: give keys only the permissions they need.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Key Rotation" icon="rotate">
    Regularly rotate your API keys, especially after team member departures.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Monitoring" icon="chart-line">
    Monitor API key usage to detect unusual patterns that might indicate compromise.

## Authentication Errors

If you provide an invalid or expired API key, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "message": "Invalid API key provided"
  }
}
```

If your API key doesn't have permission to access a specific endpoint, you'll receive a `403 Forbidden` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "permission_error",
    "message": "API key doesn't have permission to access this resource"
  }
}
```
