## Interface Layout

When you log into Atthene Agents Studio, you'll see a sidebar navigation on the left and your main workspace on the right. Let's walk through each section.

---

## Agent Overview

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/agent-overview.png" alt="Agent Overview Dashboard" />
</Frame>

Your landing page shows key metrics at a glance:

- **Total Agents**: Number of agents you've created
- **Active**: Currently running agents
- **Runs**: Total executions across all agents
- **Total Tokens**: Token consumption tracking

Click **"Create Agent"** to start building, or select from the dropdown to filter and manage existing agents.

## Core Development

### Playground

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/playground.png" alt="Playground Interface" />
</Frame>

The **Playground** is where you'll spend most of your time. It's split into two panels:

#### Left Panel: YAML Configuration Editor
- Write and edit your agent configurations
- Syntax highlighting for YAML
- Tabs for **Agents** and **Tools** view
- **Load Config** button to import saved agents or templates
- **Validate YAML** to check syntax before running
- **Format YAML** for clean, readable code
- **Save as Agent** to persist your configuration

#### Right Panel: Agent Preview
- Real-time chat interface to test your agent
- Shows connection status (Connected/Disconnected)
- Test different scenarios immediately
- See how your agent responds with current configuration

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Load the "Basic Dynamic Agent Test" template to see a working example, then modify it to understand how changes affect behavior.
</Tip>

### Knowledge Base

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/knowledge-base.png" alt="Knowledge Base Management" />
</Frame>

The **Knowledge Base** section has four main areas:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Sources">
    Upload files and connect to external data:
    - PDF documents
    - Text files
    - CSVs and structured data
    - Cloud storage connections (coming in v0.2)
    
    Click **"Add Data Source"** to upload new files.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Collections">
    Group and organize your data sources into logical collections for easier retrieval and agent assignment.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Knowledge Base">
    Process and index your data sources. View indexing status and configure retrieval parameters.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Retrieval">
    Test search and query capabilities. Configure retrieval strategies and see what your agents will find.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Each data source shows:
- **Name**: Custom identifier
- **File Name**: Original file name
- **File Details**: Size and type
- **Tags**: Organizational labels
- **Upload Info**: When it was added
- **Actions**: Edit, delete, or configure

### Tools

Browse and manage the tools available to your agents:

- **Built-in Tools**: Pre-configured capabilities (web search, calculations, etc.)
- **Custom Tools**: Tools you create for specific integrations
- **Tool Configuration**: Set default parameters and permissions

<Note>
Custom tool creation and external integrations (Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, etc.) are coming in **v0.2 (November)**.
</Note>

### Prompt Library

Save and reuse prompts across your agents:

- Create versioned prompts
- Reference them in YAML: `{{ prompt('prompt-name', 'v1') }}`
- Update prompts without changing agent configs
- A/B test different prompt versions

---

## Operations & Insights

### Tracing

Monitor your agents in production:

- **Execution Logs**: See every step your agent takes
- **Token Usage**: Track consumption by agent and conversation
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and success rates
- **Error Tracking**: Debug issues with full stack traces

### Compliance

View compliance and audit features (enterprise features):

- Conversation retention policies
- Data handling logs
- Access control audits

## Agent Settings

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/agent-settings.png" alt="Agent Settings Panel" />
</Frame>

Once you've saved an agent, access its settings to:

### General Settings

- **Agent Name**: Update the display name
- **Description**: Document what this agent does
- **Status**: Active/Inactive toggle

### Public Access

Control how your agent can be accessed:

- **Enabled/Disabled**: Toggle public access
- **Allowed Origin URL**: Whitelist domains for embedded chatbots
  - Example: `https://your-domain.com`
  - Required for security when embedding

<Warning>
When public access is **enabled**, external clients can connect using your agent key. Always configure an allowed origin URL to prevent unauthorized usage.
</Warning>

### Versions

- View version history
- Roll back to previous configurations
- Compare changes between versions

### API Keys

Generate API keys for programmatic access:

- Create multiple keys for different environments
- Revoke compromised keys instantly
- Track usage per key

## Navigation Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quick Configuration Loading">
    In the Playground, click **"Load Config"** to see:
    - Your saved agents
    - System templates
    - Recent configurations
    
    This is faster than recreating from scratch.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Testing Workflow">
    Recommended flow for testing:
    1. Load a template or your agent
    2. Make configuration changes
    3. Test in Agent Preview (right panel)
    4. Iterate until satisfied
    5. Click **"Save as Agent"**
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Knowledge Base Integration">
    To use uploaded data:
    1. Upload files in **Knowledge Base > Data Sources**
    2. Wait for processing (status will update)
    3. Reference the knowledge base in your agent YAML
    4. Test retrieval in the Agent Preview
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
