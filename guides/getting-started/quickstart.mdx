## Overview

This guide covers the essentials: create an agent, test it in the playground, add knowledge retrieval, and configure access. Expected time: 10 minutes.

<Info>
**Prerequisites**: Atthene Agents Studio account, basic YAML familiarity
</Info>

## Create Your First Agent

### Access the Playground

Navigate to **Playground** in the sidebar. You'll see:
- Left panel: YAML configuration editor
- Right panel: Agent Preview for testing

### Load a Template

Click **"Load Config"** and select **"Basic Dynamic Agent Test"** to start with a working configuration.

<Accordion title="Template structure">
```yaml
name: "Basic Dynamic Agent Test"
description: "Test configuration for basic dynamic agent loading"
save_messages: true
persistent_state: true

agents:
  - name: "test_basic_agent"
    agent_type: "llm_agent"
    description: "A simple sessional agent for testing dynamic loading"
    system_prompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant."
    llm_config:
      temperature: 1.0
      max_tokens: 500
    memory_config: {}
    knowledge_bases: []
    streaming_config:
      show_output_to_user: true

edges:
  - from: "__start__"
    to: "test_basic_agent"
  - from: "test_basic_agent"
    to: "__end__"

entry_point: "test_basic_agent"
```
</Accordion>

### Test the Agent

Click on `Load Configuration`.

Verify the Agent Preview shows **"Connected"**, then send a test message. The agent uses the loaded configuration to respond.

## Add Knowledge Retrieval

Knowledge retrieval requires creating a chain of entities: Data Source → Collection → Knowledge Base → Retrieval Method.

### Create Data Source

Navigate to **Knowledge Base** → **Data Sources** tab.

Click **"+ Add Data Source"** and upload your files. Wait for processing to complete.

### Create Collection

Go to **Collections** tab.

Click **"+ Create Collection"** and add your data source(s) to it. Collections group related documents.

### Create Knowledge Base

Navigate to **Knowledge Bases** tab.

Click **"+ Create Knowledge Base"** and select your collection. This creates a searchable index.

### Configure Retrieval Method

In **Retrieval Methods** tab:

1. Click **"+ Create Retrieval Method"**
2. Select your knowledge base
3. Configure search parameters (similarity threshold, max results, etc.)
4. Copy the generated configuration string

### Connect to Agent

Paste the copied configuration into your YAML:
```yaml
agents:
  - name: "test_basic_agent"
    knowledge_bases: ["kb_uuid_from_copied_config"]  # Paste here
```

Load the new configuration and test with questions about your uploaded content. The agent retrieves and references relevant information based on your retrieval method settings.

## Save and Deploy

### Persist Your Agent

Click **"Save as Agent"** in the editor, provide a name.

<Check>
Saved agents appear in **Agent Overview** and can be accessed via API or embedded.
</Check>

### Deploy a Version

Saving creates a new version. To make it active for API/connections:

**Agent Overview** → Select agent → **Settings** → **Versions** → Click **Deploy** on desired version

<Info>
The version with the **"current"** banner is actively deployed and handles all API requests and connections.
</Info>

### Access Your Agent from Software or Websites

Ready to integrate your agent into your applications? You can access your deployed agents through REST APIs, WebSocket connections, or embed them directly into websites and SharePoint. This enables seamless integration with existing software systems and user interfaces.
