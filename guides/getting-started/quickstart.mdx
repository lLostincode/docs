## What You'll Build

In this guide, you'll create a simple conversational agent that can:
- Answer questions using an LLM
- Access knowledge from uploaded documents
- Be tested in real-time
- Be saved for future use

**Time Required**: ~10 minutes

---

## Prerequisites

- Access to Atthene Agents Studio (closed alpha)
- Login credentials for [amas.atthene.com](https://amas.atthene.com)
- Basic familiarity with YAML syntax

---

## Step 1: Login to the Platform

Navigate to **amas.atthene.com** and sign in with your Atthene credentials.

You'll land on the **Agent Overview** dashboard.

---

## Step 2: Open the Playground

Click **Playground** in the left sidebar.

You'll see two panels:
- **Left**: YAML configuration editor
- **Right**: Agent Preview (testing interface)

---

## Step 3: Load a Template

Instead of starting from scratch, let's load a working template:

1. Click the **"Load Config"** button at the bottom of the left panel
2. Look for the **"Basic Dynamic Agent Test"** template
3. Click to load it into the editor

You should see a YAML configuration appear in the editor.

<Accordion title="What's in this template?">
```yaml
name: "Basic Dynamic Agent Test"
description: "Test configuration for basic dynamic agent loading"
save_messages: true
persistent_state: true

agents:
  - name: "test_basic_agent"
    agent_type: "llm_agent"
    description: "A simple sessional agent for testing dynamic loading"
    system_prompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant."
    llm_config:
      temperature: 1.0
      max_tokens: 500
    memory_config: {}
    knowledge_bases: []
    streaming_config:
      show_output_to_user: true

edges:
  - from: "__start__"
    to: "test_basic_agent"
  - from: "test_basic_agent"
    to: "__end__"

entry_point: "test_basic_agent"
```

This defines a single agent with basic LLM capabilities and a simple workflow.
</Accordion>

## Step 4: Test Your Agent

Now let's see it in action:

1. Look at the **Agent Preview** panel on the right
2. Check that it shows **"Connected"** status
3. Type a message in the chat input at the bottom
4. Example: "What can you help me with?"

The agent should respond using the system prompt and configuration you loaded.

<Tip>
Try different messages to see how the agent responds. You're testing in a live environmentâ€”changes to the YAML will affect the next test.
</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Add Knowledge Base Context

Let's make your agent smarter by adding some knowledge:

### Upload a Document

1. Click **Knowledge Base** in the left sidebar
2. Navigate to the **"Data Sources"** tab
3. Click **"+ Add Data Source"**
4. Upload a PDF or text file (company docs, product info, etc.)
5. Wait for the upload and processing to complete

### Connect it to Your Agent

Go back to the **Playground** and modify your YAML:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "test_basic_agent"
    agent_type: "llm_agent"
    description: "A simple sessional agent for testing dynamic loading"
    system_prompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant with access to knowledge bases."
    llm_config:
      temperature: 1.0
      max_tokens: 500
    memory_config: {}
    knowledge_bases: ["your-knowledge-base-name"]  # Add this line
    streaming_config:
      show_output_to_user: true
```

Replace `"your-knowledge-base-name"` with the name you gave your uploaded data source.

### Test Knowledge Retrieval

In the Agent Preview, ask a question about the content you uploaded:

- "What information do you have about [topic in your document]?"

The agent should now retrieve and reference your uploaded content.

---

## Step 6: Save Your Agent

Once you're happy with the configuration:

1. Click **"Save as Agent"** at the bottom of the YAML editor
2. Give your agent a name (e.g., "My First Agent")
3. Optionally add a description
4. Click **Save**

Your agent is now persisted and can be accessed from the **Agent Overview**.

---

## Step 7: Configure Public Access (Optional)

If you want to share your agent or embed it on a website:

### Enable Public Access

1. Go to **Agent Overview**
2. Find your saved agent and click on it
3. Click the **settings icon** to open Agent Settings
4. Navigate to the **"General"** tab
5. Under **"Public Access"**, toggle it to **"Enabled"**

### Set Allowed Origin

For security, specify which domains can access your agent:

1. In the **"Allowed Origin URL"** field, enter your domain
   - Example: `https://your-website.com`
2. Click **"Save URL"**

<Warning>
Without an allowed origin URL configured, external clients won't be able to connect to your agent even with public access enabled.
</Warning>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Preview shows 'Disconnected'">
    This usually means:
    - Your YAML has syntax errors (check with "Validate YAML")
    - The agent configuration is incomplete
    - WebSocket connection issues
    
    Try reloading the page or checking the browser console for errors.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Knowledge base not working">
    Make sure:
    - The data source upload is complete (check status)
    - You spelled the knowledge base name correctly in YAML
    - The knowledge base is referenced in the `knowledge_bases: []` array
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't save my agent">
    Ensure:
    - Your YAML passes validation
    - You have a unique agent name
    - All required fields are filled
  </Accordion>
