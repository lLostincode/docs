## v0.2: Extensions & Intelligence

**Expected**: November 2024  
**Focus**: Advanced configuration, model flexibility, and enterprise integrations

### Model Provider Support

Choose your LLM provider per agent:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Mistral
- Qwen
- Additional providers based on demand

<Tip>
**Need a specific model provider?** Let us know which ones matter for your use case.
</Tip>

### Advanced YAML Features

**Config Reference System**: Use variables and reference configs across agents

```yaml
variables:
  api_endpoint: "https://api.example.com"
  
agents:
  - name: "agent1"
    config_ref: "{{ variables.api_endpoint }}"
```

**Input/Output System**: Pass data between agents explicitly

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "analyzer"
    outputs: ["analysis_result"]
  
  - name: "responder"
    inputs: ["analysis_result"]
```

**Conditional Edges**: Dynamic routing based on agent outputs

```yaml
edges:
  - from: "classifier"
    to: "urgent_handler"
    condition: "output.priority == 'high'"
  
  - from: "classifier"
    to: "standard_handler"
    condition: "output.priority == 'normal'"
```

**Structured Output**: Enforce JSON schemas for agent responses

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "data_extractor"
    structured_output:
      type: "json_schema"
      schema:
        type: "object"
        properties:
          name: {type: "string"}
          age: {type: "number"}
```

### Live Avatar Chatbots

New embedded chatbot format with talking avatars:
- Default avatar library included
- Custom avatars available (enterprise requests)
- Speech-to-text user input
- Text-to-speech agent responses
- Real-time lip-sync and expressions

Perfect for customer-facing applications where visual presence matters.

<Tip>
**Interested in custom avatars?** Reach out to discuss your branding needs.
</Tip>

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Integration with the Model Context Protocol standard for:
- Standardized tool definitions
- Cross-platform agent compatibility

## v0.3: Production Readiness

**Expected**: Q1 2025  
**Focus**: Evaluation, control, and advanced orchestration

### Evaluation Framework

- Agent response quality scoring
- A/B testing for prompt variations
- Performance benchmarking
- Cost tracking per agent and conversation

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

- Approval workflows for sensitive actions
- Interactive decision points in agent flows
- User feedback collection during execution
- Manual override capabilities

### Parallel Agent Workflows

Run multiple agents simultaneously:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "researcher_1"
  - name: "researcher_2"
  - name: "researcher_3"
  - name: "aggregator"

edges:
  - from: "__start__"
    to: ["researcher_1", "researcher_2", "researcher_3"]
    mode: "parallel"
  
  - from: ["researcher_1", "researcher_2", "researcher_3"]
    to: "aggregator"
    mode: "collect"
```

### Context Engineering

- Automatic context window optimization
- Intelligent conversation summarization
- Priority-based context inclusion
- Token usage optimization

<Note>
**v0.3 feature priorities will shift** based on what v0.2 alpha users need most. Stay vocal about what matters.
</Note>

## v0.4: Autonomy & Scale

**Expected**: Q2 2025  
**Focus**: Goal-oriented agents and automation

### Planning Agent

New agent type that:
- Breaks down complex goals into steps
- Creates execution plans dynamically
- Adapts plans based on outcomes
- Coordinates sub-agents to achieve objectives

### Goal-Based Workflows

Agents work toward defined objectives with incentive structures:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "sales_assistant"
    goals:
      - objective: "schedule_meeting"
        priority: "high"
      - objective: "gather_requirements"
        priority: "medium"
```

### Intelligent Agent Collaboration

Advanced coordination methods:
- Negotiation between agents
- Consensus building
- Resource sharing
- Conflict resolution

### CronJobs & Trigger Events

- Schedule-based agent execution
- Webhook triggers from external systems
- Event-driven workflows (new email, new ticket, etc.)
- Monitoring and alerting automation

## Beyond v0.4

We're thinking about:
- **Agent Marketplace**: Community-shared agents and workflows
- **Self-Improving Agents**: Learn from past interactions
- **Multimodal Support**: Process images, audio, video
- **On-Premise Deployment**: Self-hosted for maximum control
- **Enterprise SSO**: SAML/OAuth integration

**But we're not committing yet.** These depend on how v0.2 and v0.3 land with alpha users.
