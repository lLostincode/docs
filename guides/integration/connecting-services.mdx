## Extend Your Agents' Capabilities

Atthene Agents Studio will be integrating with a lot of external services to give your agents real-world capabilities. Connect to APIs, databases, cloud storage, and third-party platforms to build agents that can actually get things done.

## Integration Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Read Data" icon="magnifying-glass" defaultOpen>
    Agents can search, retrieve, and analyze data from connected services.
    
    **Examples**: Search Google Drive, read Jira tickets, fetch customer records
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Write Data" icon="pen">
    Agents can create, update, and manage content in external platforms.
    
    **Examples**: Create Jira tickets, update spreadsheets, send emails
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Execute Actions" icon="bolt">
    Agents can trigger workflows and perform operations in connected tools.
    
    **Examples**: Deploy code, send notifications, schedule meetings
  </Accordion>
  
</AccordionGroup>

## Authentication & Security

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="OAuth 2.0" icon="shield-check" iconType="duotone">
    Secure user authentication for cloud services
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="API Keys" icon="key" iconType="duotone">
    Token-based authentication for programmatic access
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Encrypted Storage" icon="lock" iconType="duotone">
    Credentials stored securely and never exposed
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Permission Scopes" icon="user-shield" iconType="duotone">
    Fine-grained control over what agents can access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  Never hardcode credentials in your agent configurations. Always use the secure credential storage provided by the platform.
</Warning>

### What Integration Looks Like

Once connected, agents can interact with services naturally:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "ticket_manager"
    tools:
      - type: "jira"
        actions: ["create_issue", "search_issues", "update_issue"]
        auth_ref: "jira_oauth"
    
    instructions: |
      When a user reports a bug, create a Jira ticket with:
      - Title from the user's description
      - Priority based on severity keywords
      - Assign to the appropriate team
```

<Check>
  Agents handle authentication, API calls, and error handling automatically.
</Check>

### Request Your Integration

We're prioritizing integrations based on **closed alpha feedback**. If a service isn't listed, tell us about it.

<Card title="Help Us Prioritize" icon="ranking-star" iconType="duotone" color="#f59e0b" href="mailto:lorenz.stirnweis@arttacsolutions.de">
  **Email**: lorenz.stirnweis@arttacsolutions.de  
  **Subject**: "Integration Request: [Service Name]"
  
  Include:
  - Which service you need
  - What you want agents to do with it
  - How critical it is for your use case
  - Expected usage volume
</Card>
