The Atthene Multi-Agent System provides different agent types, each optimized for specific use cases and interaction patterns. This guide helps you choose the right agent type for your needs.

## Available Agent Types

### LLM Agent

**Type identifier**: `llm_agent`

The most basic agent type, powered by a large language model. Best for conversational interactions and tasks that don't require external tools or complex reasoning patterns.

    - Content generation
    - Question answering
    - Text summarization
    - General chat interactions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Capabilities" icon="check">
    - ✅ Streaming support
    - ✅ Knowledge base integration
    - ✅ Memory support
    - ❌ No tool calling
    - Configurable LLM parameters

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "assistant"
    agent_type: "llm_agent"
    description: "A helpful conversational assistant"
    
    system_prompt: |
      You are a helpful AI assistant. Provide clear, accurate, 
      and friendly responses to user questions.
    
    llm_config:
      model: "gpt-4o"
      temperature: 0.7
      max_tokens: 1000
    
    streaming_config:
      enable_streaming: true
      show_output_to_user: true
```

#### When to Use

<Check>Use LLM agents when you need straightforward conversational interactions without external tool access</Check>

<Check>Ideal for customer support, content creation, or general Q&A scenarios</Check>

### ReAct Agent

**Type identifier**: `react_agent`

Implements the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern, enabling agents to use tools and external resources. The agent reasons about what actions to take, executes tools, and incorporates results into its responses.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Best For" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    - Web search and research
    - Data retrieval and analysis
    - Multi-step problem solving
    - Tasks requiring external information
    - Any task needing tool integration
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Capabilities" icon="check">
    - ✅ **Tool calling and execution**
    - ✅ Knowledge base integration
    - ✅ Memory support
    - ❌ Streaming disabled
    - Iterative reasoning loops
    - Thought process visibility
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "research_assistant"
    agent_type: "react_agent"
    description: "AI assistant with research and analysis capabilities"
    
    system_prompt: |
      You are a research assistant with access to web search and calculation tools.
      
      When solving problems:
      1. Break down the task into steps
      2. Use tools to gather information
      3. Analyze the results
      4. Provide a comprehensive answer
    
    tools:
      - "tavily_search"
      - "tavily_extract"
      - "calculator"
    
    tool_calling:
      enabled: true
      max_iterations: 10
    
    llm_config:
      model: "gpt-4o"
      temperature: 0.1
      max_tokens: 2000
    
    streaming_config:
      enable_streaming: true
      show_output_to_user: true
      show_reasoning: true
      show_tool_to_user: true
```

#### ReAct Pattern Flow

```
User Query → Agent Reasoning → Tool Selection → Tool Execution → 
Result Analysis → More Tools? → Final Response
```

#### When to Use

<Check>Use ReAct agents when tasks require external information or computations</Check>

<Check>Perfect for research, data analysis, fact-checking, or complex problem-solving</Check>

<Warning>
Set appropriate `max_iterations` to prevent infinite reasoning loops. Recommended: 5-15 iterations.
</Warning>

### Supervisor Agent

**Type identifier**: `supervisor`

Coordinates multiple specialized worker agents, routing tasks to the most appropriate agent and managing multi-agent workflows. Acts as an intelligent orchestrator.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Best For" icon="users">
    - Multi-domain systems
    - Complex workflows
    - Task delegation
    - Team coordination
    - Specialized agent teams
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Capabilities" icon="check">
    - ✅ Streaming support
    - ✅ Tool calling (for handoffs)
    - ✅ Memory support
    - Dynamic agent routing
    - Agent handoffs
    - Workflow coordination
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "team_supervisor"
    agent_type: "supervisor"
    description: "Coordinates specialized team members"
    
    # Define which agents this supervisor manages
    supervised_agents: 
      - "research_agent"
      - "analysis_agent"
      - "writer_agent"
    
    # Control coordination flow
    return_to_supervisor: true
    max_handoffs: 15
    
    supervisor_prompt: |
      You are a team supervisor coordinating specialized agents.
      
      Your team:
      - research_agent: Gathers information via web search
      - analysis_agent: Analyzes data and identifies patterns
      - writer_agent: Creates polished written content
      
      INSTRUCTIONS:
      - Immediately delegate tasks to the appropriate specialist
      - Use transfer tools to hand off work
      - Provide clear context when transferring
      - Evaluate results and decide next steps
    
    streaming_config:
      enable_streaming: true
      show_output_to_user: true
```

#### Supervisor Coordination Patterns

**One-Way Delegation** (`return_to_supervisor: false`):
```
User → Supervisor → Worker Agent → User
```
Simple routing where workers respond directly to users.

**Iterative Coordination** (`return_to_supervisor: true`):
```
User → Supervisor → Worker 1 → Supervisor → Worker 2 → Supervisor → User
```
Supervisor evaluates each step and orchestrates multi-agent workflows.

#### When to Use

<Check>Use supervisors when you have multiple specialized agents that need coordination</Check>

<Check>Ideal for complex systems requiring task decomposition and delegation</Check>

<Tip>
Combine different agent types under a supervisor: use ReAct agents for research, LLM agents for synthesis.
</Tip>

## Configuration Best Practices

### LLM Agent Best Practices

<Tip>
**Temperature**: Use 0.7-1.0 for creative tasks, 0.1-0.3 for factual responses
</Tip>

<Tip>
**System Prompt**: Be specific about tone, style, and response format
</Tip>

### ReAct Agent Best Practices

<Tip>
**Max Iterations**: Set to 5-10 for most tasks. Higher values (15+) only for complex research.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Tool Selection**: Only include tools the agent actually needs. More tools = more complexity.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Show Reasoning**: Enable `show_reasoning: true` during development to debug tool usage patterns.
</Tip>

### Supervisor Best Practices

<Tip>
**Clear Delegation**: Write explicit instructions in `supervisor_prompt` about when to use each worker.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Return Strategy**: Use `return_to_supervisor: true` for quality control and multi-step workflows.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Max Handoffs**: Set reasonable limits (10-20) to prevent infinite coordination loops.
</Warning>

## Advanced Patterns

### Hybrid Teams

Combine multiple agent types for sophisticated systems:

```yaml
agents:
  # Supervisor coordinates the team
  - name: "supervisor"
    agent_type: "supervisor"
    supervised_agents: ["researcher", "analyst", "writer"]
  
  # ReAct agent for research
  - name: "researcher"
    agent_type: "react_agent"
    tools: ["tavily_search", "tavily_extract"]
  
  # ReAct agent for analysis
  - name: "analyst"
    agent_type: "react_agent"
    tools: ["calculator"]
  
  # LLM agent for final synthesis
  - name: "writer"
    agent_type: "llm_agent"
    llm_config:
      temperature: 0.8  # More creative for writing
```

### Specialized Workers

Create domain-specific agents by customizing system prompts:

```yaml
- name: "technical_expert"
  agent_type: "react_agent"
  system_prompt: |
    You are a senior software engineer specializing in Python and system architecture.
    Provide technical, detailed responses with code examples.
  tools: ["web_search"]

- name: "business_expert"
  agent_type: "llm_agent"
  system_prompt: |
    You are a business strategy consultant with MBA-level expertise.
    Focus on ROI, market analysis, and strategic recommendations.
```
